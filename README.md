# Spy Network Communication System

## Overview
This was an assignment for CS 2ME3 at McMaster University. The project is a Java-based simulation of a secure communication system within a spy network. It's designed to showcase skills in software design and object-oriented programming. The assignment challenged me to create a system that enables secure, encrypted communication between various entities in a spy network, adapting dynamically to different encryption schemes and potential security threats.The requirements for this assignment were as follows:

## Assignment Requirements
- Develop a secure communication system for a network of spies.
- Implement different encryption methods for message security.
- Utilize design patterns to structure the system effectively.
- Ensure the system can adapt to changing security protocols.

## Key Features
- **Encryption Algorithms**: Implements Caesar and Caesar2 ciphers for message encryption and decryption.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Utilizes the Decorator pattern to dynamically add encryption layers.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single instance of the Homebase class.
- **Observer Pattern**: Allows field bases and spies to stay updated with changes from the home base.

## What I learned
- **Design Patterns**: Gained hands-on experience with Singleton, Observer, and Decorator patterns, enhancing my understanding of software design principles.
- **Encryption Techniques**: Learned about basic encryption techniques and their implementation in Java.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Strengthened skills in object-oriented programming, particularly in using interfaces and abstract classes.
- **System Design**: Understood the importance of system design in creating scalable and maintainable software.
